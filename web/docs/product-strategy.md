# Product Strategy: Daily Scrum Master Selector

## Product Vision

A simple, frictionless web application that eliminates the daily question "Who's running standup today?" for fully remote teams by automatically cycling through team members fairly while keeping the experience engaging and educational.

## Product Positioning

### Problem Statement
Remote teams waste 2-3 minutes daily deciding who runs standup, often defaulting to the same people or experiencing awkward silences. Traditional rotation methods (spreadsheets, manual tracking) are forgotten or ignored, leading to unfair distribution of facilitation duties.

### Solution
An automated, fair rotation system with built-in engagement features that makes scrum master selection effortless while providing daily value through standup tips and team building elements.

### Market Opportunity
- 42% of US workforce now works remotely (2023)
- Average team conducts 5 standups per week
- 15-30 seconds saved per standup = 2.5 hours annually per team
- Improved meeting facilitation quality through educational content
